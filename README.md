Once you get an activity, two buttons will appear. A "Show More Information" button will tell you how many participants you need and what type of activity it is, and an "I Love This" button will let you save the activity for later.

Once you click the "I Love This Button", the activity will simply appear under the Favorites section, where this is also a delete button that will delete the activity should you change your mind about it.

Lastly, there is a comment section. Simply, add in comments for next time you do that activity. In this section, you will also be able to delete any comments, should you not need them anymore.
